# REFITT
**Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking**

## Setup
### Packages/Dependencies
- george
- Keras
- sncosmo, sfdmap
- elasticsearch_dsl
- antares-client
- tslearn (optional)

### Prep
pip install .
tar xzf data/lib_gen/train_lcs.tar.gz -C data/lib_gen

### Generate Library
Run make_library_ZTF.py in place using submit_make_library_ZTF.py
This will generate training LCs under data/class
Takes 2.5hrs for Ia and <1hr for rest

### Training
1. Build CAE reps for each library LC from horizon-window days by running make_reps.py.
takes ~11-15 hours per epoch on 1 full brown node

2. Make ball trees by running make_balltrees.py
takes ~5-6 hours per epoch (per core) and can be run in parallel
Caution: Each balltree is 2.2GB

3. Find k for each integer time since trigger
run find_kNN.py via submit_find_kNN.py 
takes 4 days per epoch but can be run in parallel

4. Run kNN_optimal.py to find best k from obj_phase.npy files written in step 3.
Useful to examine loss in obj.png
Loss curves are not converged for less than 9 days since trigger
Overall results are only reliable after 10 days since trigger – hardsetting to 10’s k for earlier times

## Data files for above
One only needs the training LCs, balltree_AE_*, obj_*, and optimal_kNN files to run. 
These files are large and therefore not included here but can be made available on request.

## Running live
Simply execute run.py

Results will be placed in a subfolder ZTF/ZTF_%Y-%m-%dT%H%M
Priority lists are in a deeper subfolder /priority

Note: prioritize_old.py is legacy and will be removed in the future

# Disclaimer:
While I have tried my best to document all steps to make sure REFITT works on any machine, I have only ever set it up on mine. 
If you are running into errors following the steps, please do reach out and I will help fix it and push an update. 
Alternately, if you do end up fixing the issue yourself, please share your fix anyway or send a pull request for the benefit of everyone.

# Notes:
### Major changes from Sravan+2020:
- predicting class and forecasting on class
- loss is error on full forecast
- Cross corr align

### Future improvements:
- Forecasts for bright transients and decaying transients is not good
- System uses LC only - host information would help (redshift+env properties)

### Laundry list:
- Use spec class or probabilistic class
- Use host info (redshift, offset, morphology)
